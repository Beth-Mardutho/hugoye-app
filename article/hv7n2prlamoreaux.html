                              volume at hand inaugurates an exciting new series. Entitled
                              <i>Eastern Christian Texts</i>, this series is published by the
                              Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI) of Brigham Young
                              University. Like its counterpart, the well-received <i>Islamic
                                 Translation Series</i>, likewise published by METI, this series
                              offers English translations of seminal works, accompanied on
                              facing page by texts in their original language. In terms of
                              scope, <i>Eastern Christian Texts</i> is to include works from
                              all of the diverse eastern Christian communities. In terms of
                              audience, it is aimed both at specialists and non-specialists.
                              Accompanying this new series is another, <i>The Library of the
                                 Christian East</i>, also published by METI. This second series
                              will offer extensive introductions to important authors, with
                              selections of their writings in translation, as well as surveys

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[2] The
                              present volume is the first translation into English of Yahya
                              ibn ʿAdi's (d. 974) <i>Tahdhib
                                 al-akhlaq.</i> This work is a multifarious ethical
                              compendium. In part, it is concerned with philosophical issues:
                              the nature of human moral qualities; the character of the
                              tripartite soul; the cataloguing and definition of virtues and
                              vices; and how the baser parts of the soul might be made
                              subject to its rational part. In part, it is a mirror for
                              princes, offering a description of the perfect ruler and gentle
                              advice for those less than perfect—not least among their
                              neglected duties being the support of scholars. In part, it is
                              a hortative discourse, aiming at the "instruction of
                              prospective students and future leaders ... be they Muslim or
                              Christian, in order to inculcate in them the requisite moral
                              attitude for the practice of the philosophical way of life"
                              (xlii), that they might become as "the perfect man"
                              (<i>al-insan al-kamil</i>).
                           </p>

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[3] There
                              can be no doubt that Yahya's work merits its place at the head
                              of a series designed to present seminal works of the eastern
                              Christian tradition. Its author was one of the most famous and
                              most prolific of Christian Arab philosophers. A member of the
                              Syrian Orthodox Church, he was a student of al-Farabi and of
                              al-Farabi's own teacher, Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus, and was
                              himself the teacher of many who would go on to renown of their
                              own. He is a figure perhaps best known for his contributions to
                              the formation of the Aristotelian school of Baghdad. Moreover,
                              of Yahya's many works, the present is one of his most popular,
                              a fact well illustrated by the number of manuscripts in which
                              it survives (more than twenty) and by the number of times it
                              has been edited (to date, twenty). The most recent and best of
                              these editions was prepared by Samir Khalil, published as
                              <i>Yahya ibn ʿAdi (893-974): Tahdhib
                                 al-ahlaq</i> (Beirut: CEDRAC, 1994). It is this text, sans
                              apparatus, that has been taken as the basis of the present
                              translation and printed on the facing page, with full
                              vocalization.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[4] Griffith
                              opens his volume with an introduction to the life of Yahya, the
                              context within which he lived and wrote, a presentation of
                              Yahya's <i>Reformation of Morals</i>, and a placing of it in
                              its social and literary context. As Griffith argues, Yahya's is
                              a singular work. It shares much with earlier discussions of
                              ethics in the Hellenic, pre-Islamic, and Persianate traditions.
                              There are superficially similar works in the Muslim
                              philosophical tradition. Even so, Yahya's work is unique. While
                              he drew on sources many and diverse, Yahya crafted from those
                              sources his own vision of the philosophical life. And
                              strikingly, this vision is absent religious reference. Its
                              conceptual framework is the human being and the pursuit of
                              happiness through humane ideals. This is not to say that the
                              work is opposed to the monotheisms of the early medieval Near
                              East. Indeed, as Griffith argues, it offers an understanding of
                              the philosophical life, such that it might be pursued by
                              adherents of any of the faith traditions, having as its ideal
                              perfect humanity (<i>insaniyah</i>), "that is to say, humane
                              behavior in the social sphere ... a prerequisite for the
                              well-being of both philosophy and religion in society" (p.
                              xliii).
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="tei-p text-display" id="id.">
                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[5] As to
                              manner of translation, Griffith's goal was "accurately to
                              express the thought of Yahya ibn ʿAdi in a
                              literal rendering of the Arabic, consistent with the
                              requirements of intelligible English expression" (p. xlvi).
                              That he achieved that goal is evident throughout. Indeed, he
                              has achieved far more. Yahya's cannot have been an easy work to
                              translate. Modern English frequently lacks words, clearly
                              defined in semantic range, with which to express the sorts of
                              ethical states, virtues, and vices discussed by Yahya. And what
                              words there are often exist only in religious discourse.
                              Yahya's translator carefully avoids English terms that bear
                              overly religious significance, and has remained faithful to
                              Yahya's own vision of "perfect humanity." Furthermore,
                              Yahya's text is composed in a form of ornamental, rhythmic
                              prose, in which style at times takes precedence over the
                              ordered presentation of ideas. Rather than Yahya's normal,
                              syllogistic manner of presentation, in this text each
                              rhetorical period is meant to be savored in for itself. The
                              work is, as it were, a collection of beautifully ornate
                              proverbs and bons mots, delicately interwoven. Yahya's
                              translator captures a sense of the gossamer beauty of his
                              Arabic original, and has enabled Yahya's graceful prose to
                              shine through, even in English guise.
