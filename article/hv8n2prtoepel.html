                              of its comparative proximity the modern history of the Church
                              of the East remains one of the underdeveloped fields in the
                              study of Eastern Christianity. Any publication on this subject
                              is, therefore, to be welcomed, and in regard of the book under
                              review here this is the more so, since its author, His Grace
                              Mar Aprem, Metropolitan of All India, to a great extent not
                              only witnessed but shaped the history of the Assyrian Church of
                              the East during the last forty years. As is to be expected, the
                              book deals first and foremost with the history of this church,
                              while the uniate Chaldaean church, which ultimately stems from
                              the same tradition, receives only minor attention. After two
                              introductory chapters on the origins and history of the
                              Assyrian Church until 1900 (pp. 17-67) its history during the
                              twentieth century is presented according to a division into
                              four periods: a period of decline from 1900 to 1918 (pp.
                              69-112), a period of uncertainty from 1918-1933 (pp. 114-164),
                              a period of sufferings from 1933-1975 (pp. 166-184) and finally
                              the ecumenical era from 1976 to the present (pp. 186-216). The
                              book contains several appendices which include documents of
                              interest, such as the 1994 Common Christological Declaration of
                              Pope John Paul II. and Catholicos Mar Dinkha IV. as well as a
                              Joint Synodal Decree of the Assyrian and Chaldaean churches for
                              promoting unity among each other from 1997.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[2] As the
                              distribution of page numbers shows, the major part of the book
                              deals with the period from 1900-1933 and it is here that the
                              author makes a real contribution by drawing upon the riches of
                              the Syriac manuscript libraries in India. Especially on pp.
                              117-157 the account is based entirely upon the letters of Mar
                              Abimalek Timotheus, Metropolitan of All India from 1908-1945,
                              who acted as regent to the young patriarch Eshai Shimun in the
                              early 1920's and, during that time, took an active role in the
                              politics of his church. Hereby the author opens up an "Indian
                              perspective" on Nestorian church history in the twentieth
                              century, a perspective which is largely absent in the few
                              hitherto available works on this subject. Likewise informative
                              is the section on the ecumenical era from 1976 to the present,
                              in which the author himself played a significant role and thus
                              is able to present an eye-witness account.
                           </p>

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[3] Apart
                              from these issues which are treated in detail, at other points
                              there is a potential of deepening the investigation. To begin
                              with, the book is purely church-historical in character, which
                              means that the political aspect of the narrated events is not
                              expressly stated. For the uninformed reader, however, at times
                              it would have been useful to include some background
                              information. Since Assyrian church history prior to World War I
                              took place within the framework of the Ottoman Empire and its
                              policies towards religious minorities, a knowledge of the
                              <i>millet</i> system is necessary for understanding some
                              peculiarities of this church's history in the 1920's and 30's.
                              On p. 158 the patriarch's temporal power is briefly mentioned,
                              but it is not made clear how far this claim to civil
                              jurisdiction is related to the Ottoman law system. In addition
                              it has to be said that the account on pp. 157-159 is—as
                              the author on p. 157 n. 65 himself acknowledges—based
                              upon an account friendly towards Patriarch Eshai Shimun. In
                              fact it seems to have been the case not so much that British or
                              Iraqi officials tried to diminish the influence of the
                              patriarchal family but rather that the Patriarch himself
                              insisted upon retaining (and presumably exercising) his
                              temporal power, and that this was the main reason for his
                              eventual expulsion from Iraq (cf. J. Joseph, <i>The Nestorians
                                 and their Muslim Neighbors</i> [Princeton: Princeton University
                              Press, 1961], pp. 198-200; G. Yonan, <i>Assyrer heute</i>
                              [Hamburg: Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker, 1978],
                              pp. 60-61).
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="tei-p text-display" id="id.">
                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[4] The same
                              holds true in regard of the Patriarch's relationship to the
                              Nestorian military leader Agha Petros, which could have been
                              treated in more depth than is actually the case on pp. 116-117,
                              157. Especially on p. 157 the Agha's rather dubious role in the
                              repatriation attempt of 1919 is not mentioned at all. Another
                              issue which carries the potential of more detailed treatment is
                              the question of "Assyrian" nationalism. In the title and
                              throughout the book the term "Assyrian" is used as a
                              denominational marker in accordance with this church's official
                              usage since the 1940's (cf. Yonan, <i>Assyrer</i>, p. 154). It
                              is, however, to be regretted that the background of this term,
                              which originally was applied in an ethnic sense, is not
                              explored in greater detail, especially since the works by J.
                              Joseph and J. F. Coakley (cf. Joseph, <i>Nestorians</i>, pp.
                              13-21; J. F. Coakley, <i>The Church of the East and the Church
                                 of England</i> [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992], p. 4-6 with n.
                              12)—upon which the account on pp. 51-67, 99-110 otherwise
                              is heavily dependent—contain lengthy sections on
                              this.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="tei-p text-display" id="id.">
                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[5] Finally
                              it has to be asked whether—given the fact that
                              Mesopotamia at this time was regarded as being vital to British
                              imperial interests (cf. D. Fromkin, <i>A Peace to End All
                                 Peace</i> [London: André Deutsch, 1989], pp. 146-149,
                              449-454, 558-567)—the motive behind the Anglican church's
                              "mission of help" (p. 69) was really as altruistic as it is
                              presented on pp. 69 and 85. Even in the missionary W. A.
                              Wigram's letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1911,
                              which is quoted on pp. 96-98, the link between the Church of
                              England's missionary work and the political interests of the
                              British Empire is made unmistakably clear. In this respect the
                              Anglican determination to preserve the Church in the East in
                              its original state rather appears as an attempt to keep it from
                              falling under Presbyterian, Catholic or Russian Orthodox sway
                              and the influence of the countries behind these churches,
                              namely the United States, France and Russia. Notwithstanding
                              the good intentions of individual churchmen this seems to have
                              been a serious motive behind the help which the Assyrians
                              received from the Anglican church and the British crown (cf.
                              Joseph, <i>Nestorians</i>, pp. 87-92, 95-107). British military
                              interest in the Assyrians is made especially clear by the
                              history of the Iraq Levies, which consisted of Nestorian
                              tribesmen and played a vital role during the British mandate in
                              Iraq and even in World War II (cf. Yonan, <i>Assyrer</i>, pp.
                              56-57, 74-76). These are briefly mentioned on p. 154 in
                              connection with the Indian metropolitan Mar Timotheus' failed
                              attempt to visit their bases in 1927. In order to understand,
                              however, why the British authorities refused to give Mar
                              Timotheus, who at this time opposed the Patriarch Eshai Shimun,
                              access to their Assyrian levy troops it would have been helpful
                              to refer to the political situation outlined just above.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[6] For
                              clarity's sake it is furthermore necessary to indicate a few
                              minor inaccuracies. (p. 30-31) Obviously Rabban Sauma is
                              confused with Marqos, later Patriarch Yahballaha III. Marqos
                              never visited Rome and therefore cannot have been blessed by
                              the pope (p. 31) Here it is stated that after Timur's genocide
                              the Church of the East "never had peaceful days". There are,
                              however, no massacres reported until 1843 (cf. Joseph,
                              <i>Nestorians</i>, pp. 29-30). (p. 99) Kemal Atatürk was
                              not involved in the Young Turk revolution of 1908. The person
                              in question here is probably Kemal Pasha. Last but not least an
                              index would substantially facilitate the use of the book.
                           </p>

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[7] These
                              points notwithstanding, the book's strength remains that for
                              the first time it affords a glimpse into the rich archive
                              material in India which for the larger part still awaits
                              investigation. By giving access to this material the author
                              points towards a dimension of Nestorian church history which
                              lies beyond the question of ethnic minorities in the Middle
                              East. The book thus not only provides a useful update on the
                              history of the Assyrian Church, but draws attention to the
                              erstwhile truly ecumenical and global character of the Church
                              of the East, which is gradually being recovered today.
