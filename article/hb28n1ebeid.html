<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>In 1924, Giuseppe Furlani published an Italian translation of  an  anti-Tritheist  florilegium  he  found  in  MS  BL  Add 14532. His translation focused mainly on the chapter titles in the  florilegium and the  quotations  from the works  of John Philoponus. In 1980, Albert van Roey published the Syriac  Trinitarian  fragments  of  Philoponus,  found  in various  manuscripts, their  Latin translation.  Van  Roey’s  contribution  also  presented  the same florilegium, as found in MS BL Add 14538 as well as 14532, and identified most of the patristic passages quoted by the compiler. Both scholars, besides some  inaccurate readings  and  some  errors identifications,  paid attention only to the quotations of Philoponus, while the Trinitarian  position  of  the  compiler  and  his  identity</p>

In  doing  so  I  will  first  present  the florilegium,  illustrate  the  profile  of  the  compiler,  his sources, and a probable date and place of his compilation of the florilegium as well as the doctrinal context in which this text was composed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>found</p>
<p>fragments  of  Philoponus</p>
<p>In 1924, Giuseppe Furlani published an Italian translation of an anti-Tritheist  florilegium  he  found  in  MS  BL  Add  14532.  His translation  focused  mainly  on  the  chapter  titles  in  the florilegium  and  the  quotations  from  the  works  of  John Philoponus.1  In  1980,  Albert  van  Roey  published  the  Syriac Trinitarian in  various manuscripts, together with their Latin translation. Van Roey’s contribution  presented  the  same  florilegium,  as  found  in  two manuscripts,  namely  MSS  BL  Add  14532  and  14538,  he  also identified  most  of  the  patristic  passages  quoted  by  the compiler.2  In  this  study,  I  aim  to  present  the  florilegium,  to examine the profile of the compiler, his sources, and a probable date  for  its  compilation.  A  comparative  analysis  of  the Trinitarian  position  of  the  florilegium’s  complier  and  that  of Damian  of  Alexandria  will  also  be  productive  in  that  it  will further  illustrate  the  second  phase  of  the  anti-Tritheistic controversy among Syrian Miaphysites and will call attention to probable  contacts  between  the  Syriac  community  where  this</p>

<p>florilegium was composed and Damian of Alexandria, and will provide evidence that it was probably against this community that Peter of Callinicum wrote his Contra Damianum.</p>
<p>THE ANTI-TRITHEIST FLORILEGIUM</p>
<p>This anti-Tritheist florilegium is preserved, as far as I know, in two  manuscripts  of  the  British  Library,  namely  MS  BL  Add. 14532 ff. 194r-207v and MS BL Add. 14538, 140r-145r.3 Recently I published a critical digital edition of this florilegium, including identifications of the patristic passages, the original Greek texts, where they exist, and other metadata.4</p>
<p>The structure of the florilegium is as follows: a general title, an introduction, five chapters and a conclusion. The chapters also  have  the  same  structure,  each  has  a  title  that  can  be considered  an  introduction  to  the  contents  of  the  chapter, followed  by  quotations  from  the  Trinitarian  writings  of  John Philoponus, and then others from various Church Fathers, like Basil  of  Caesarea,  Gregory  of  Nazianzus,  Cyril  of  Alexandria, and  Severus  of  Antioch.5  The  general  introduction  mentions that on comparison of the respective doctrines it will be clear to the reader, even if an intellectually simple person,  that the doctrine of John Philoponus disagrees with the teaching of the Church Fathers.6 Moreover, in the introduction to each chapter,</p>
<p>3 According to Wright MS BL Add. 15432 was copied during the 8th century while MS BL Add. 15438 can be dated to the 10th century, see respectively W. Wright,  Catalogue  of  Syriac  Manuscripts  in  the  British  Museum,  Acquired since the Year 1838, vol. II (London: British Library, 1871), 955–967, 1003-1008.</p>

See also the names of the quoted Fathers identified by Furlani, “Un florilegio”, 661–662; for the passages identified by van Roey  and  their original sources  see van Roey, “Les fragments”, 137–145.</p>

<p>the compiler presents the topics dealt with in the quotations, and expresses his own position with comments on them.</p>
<p>The tables that follow give the general title of the florilegium, the general introduction and conclusion. In addition I present: 1) the titles of the chapters; 2) the  Fathers mentioned in each chapter, their quoted works, identification of these quotations; and  3)  the  main  topics  treated  in  the  quotations.7  Footnotes, make  reference  to  the  editions  of  the  original  texts  of  the quotations in question and offer observations as well as some disagreements with the readings of both G. Furlani and A. van Roey.8</p>

<p>8 It must be mentioned that Furlani translated all the passages by John Philoponus  into  Italian,  while  for  the  patristic  quotations  he  gave  Italian translations of the beginning and end of each passage without any precise identification of the Greek sources; for the Syriac sources, he gave details of the  works  of  Severus  of  Antioch  that  had  so  far  been  edited.  However,  as mentioned in the introduction to this study, van Roey identified most of the patristic passages quoted in this florilegium.</p>

<p>[Introduction]</p>
<p>We are expressly irate because of the wickedness of some persons that is demonstrated in the following chapters. However,  in  order  not  to  fall  into  many  words,  since neither the ink nor time allows us, we will speak later on little things among the many blasphemies we are irritated by,  and  we  will  quote  a  few  testimonies  of  the  Holy Fathers to whom we are adherent, so that when these are compared to each other, their opposition [i.e. that of John and his followers] will be recognized even by those who are very simple [intellectually].12</p>

<p>[Chapter one]19 For  while  the  Holy  Fathers  teach  that  one  substance, [one] Divinity and [one] God is in three hypostases, that is, persons and properties, which is the foundation and the  fulfilment  of  all  Christians,  and  again  they  [the Fathers] call this same one substance of the hypostases principal (primary) substance, these [the adversaries] in the audacity of their heart go against the Holy Spirit and, in their impudence,  call  the  substance,  which the Holy Fathers name principal, non-principal. Not only this, but they also define that this substance and God and Divinity [i.e. the non-principal] is either only in mere thought or nothing,  giving  up  hope  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  who  speaks through the Holy Fathers and inheres in Aristotle.</p>

<p>18 C: ܝܗܘܠܐܬ 19 Because the title ‘Chapter one’ is missing in the two manuscripts, as we shall see in the next section, Furlani considered the introduction to the first chapter to be a part of the general introduction of the florilegium. Van Roey, however, considers the general introduction and that of the first chapter to be separate items.

<p>The common substance, even if does not exist, is divisible, and therefore numerable through its hypostases, that is, the single existences that participate in it.</p>
<p>God is neither one in number (as in the monotheism of the Jews) nor four hypostases (in the meaning, three hypostasis and one existing common substance).</p>

<p>Again about the fact that, while the Holy Fathers fought many struggles and [shed much] sweat to teach that the substance and the Divinity of the Holy Trinity is one and the  same,  [and]  that  the  Father,  the  Son  and  the  Holy Spirit  are  consubstantial,  these  [the  adversaries]  - contending  with  much  impiety  against  the  Holy  Spirit, who spoke through the Holy Fathers - do not confess one principal  Divinity,  but  gods  and  divinities,  and  walking into  error,  they  arrived  at  the  absurdity  of  all  this,  to confess that God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are different according to species (ἑτεροειδεῖς) and different according to substance (ἑτεροούσιοι).</p>

<p>If the hypostases are not recognized as single substances it means that they are simply names and this leads to Sabellianism.</p>
<p>The hypostases of the same substance are equal and similar in substance, that is, they are not different in substance, even if each has its own property which makes it different from the other, and therefore one might affirm that each hypostasis with its own property is different in species from the other hypostases that share the same common substance.</p>
<p>The one common divine substance subsists in three</p>

<p>Again,  while  the  Holy  Fathers,  enlightened  by the Holy Spirit who spoke through them, put forward the word of consubstantiality to mean, through it [i.e. this concept], one substance and three hypostases of the Holy Trinity in order to cancel and abolish the polytheism of Arius and the atheism of Sabellius, these [the adversaries], with the arrogance  of  their  great  impiety,  do  not  follow  in  the footsteps  of  the  Holy  Fathers,  but  they  say  that in consubstantiality</p>

Note  that  van  Roey  did  not  identify  any  Greek  source  for  this quotation,  but  indicated  some  probable  Latin  sources  in  the  PL  (see  van Roey, “Les fragments”, 141). The reason might be the fact that the passage is not from Damasus’ Synodical Letter as the compiler maintains, but from his Profession  of  Faith,  known  also  as  Damasus’  Tome.  Moreover,  it  is  worth mentioning  that  this  passage  is,  in  fact,  a  combination  of  two  separate quotations from the same work.</p>

<p>Chapter Five About the [fact] that while usually the divine Scriptures and  the  Holy  Fathers  split  the  concepts,  which  some persons misuse to establish their wicked thought, even if some  of  the  ancient  [Fathers]  used  them,  and  even  if among those who have split them, there are some who have said them, these [the adversaries] in their audacity have despised the divine and medical economy. And after the excommunication of the pious patriarch Theodosius of Alexandria, whom they also say they accept, he who, following the Holy Fathers in all instructions, and by the action  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  prohibited  the  application  of both  defined  and  indefinite  number  of  substances  or natures concerning the Holy and consubstantial Trinity, these [the adversaries], however, oppose, as always, the Holy Spirit, and after the excommunication of the pious [Theodosius],  they  [still]  confess  and  teach  substances and natures concerning the Holy Trinity. Thus, because of this  they  introduce  consubstantial  gods  and  divinities into the doctrine of Christians, as was clearly seen in the third chapter put down above.80</p>

<p>[Conclusion]106 Since,  however,  all  heretics  have  the  habit  of  hiding their evil  thinking  in order  to deceive  the  listeners and make them believe that they want the truth, resembling in this the Evil who is the source of all wickedness, and many times they make wrong use of the Divine Scriptures and  the  doctors  of  the  Mysteries  to  hide  their  impiety, and  they  make  fraudulent  apologies  in  order  to  escape what they are reproached for, like the Jews, who verbally demonstrate that they accept the Law and the Prophets, but in fact they deny them; and similarly the Ammonites who in words confess the true Son of God the Father, but in reality deny him, and Paul of Samosata and Nestorius and their followers, who being careful to mislead, they, in</p>
<p>106  As  we  shall  see  below,  I  consider  this  part  a  conclusion  of  the florilegium  agreeing to some extent  with Furlani  in this regard. Van Roey, however,  does  not  include  this  passage  in  his  analysis.  For  references  see below.</p>

<p>words, do not confess two Sons and two Christs, but one, in reality, however, they are reproached for teaching two Sons and two Christs; then the Julianists, who in words confess  that  Christ  suffered,  but  in  reality  demonstrate that they [follow] the opposite [doctrine]; so also those who dare to utter substances and natures concerning the Holy and consubstantial Trinity, in order to deceive those who  listen  [to  them]  and  to  escape  from  an  evident confutation,  they  say  just  in  words  one  God  and  one Divinity  and  one  substance  that  is,  nature,  which  they prove to confess to be nothing but a mere word in mere thought.  [And]  while  they  are  blotting  out  to  confess principally one God and one Divinity, one substance, that is, nature in three Holy hypostases of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as the Divine Scriptures and the Holy Fathers they  are  evidently  caught  boldly confessing  gods,  divinities,  substances  and  natures concerning  the  Holy  and  consubstantial Trinity,  as  was shown  through  the  blasphemies  set  down  [above].  No one  should  believe  them,  because  in  the  Scripture[s] those  who  confess  substances,  natures,  gods  and divinities concerning the Holy and consubstantial Trinity are anathematized, although they say [that] these [gods] are consubstantial, as also the Holy Theodosius refused, who  [now]  is  among  the  saints.  No  one  must  believe heretics,  because,  as  with  lambskin,  they  cover  and conceal  their  wickedness  through  beautiful  words [taken] from the Holy Scriptures, and they do not think what they [really] say and do not say what they [really] think, so that no one gets bored by them, they, in fact had learned this from the Evil, their father.</p>
<p>teach,</p>
<p>To prove, then, that this is so, we will cite, in order to conclude  in  a  good  way,  the  word  of  the  Apostle</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Hugoye 28.1</p>
<p>Athanasius from the first discourse against the Arians,107 when  warning  [the  reader]  from  their  wickedness,  he says the following:</p>
<p>And  however  they  may  write  phrases  out  of  the Scripture,  endure  not  their  writings;  however  they  may speak  the  language  of  the  orthodox,  yet  attend  not  to what they say; for they speak not with an upright mind, but  putting  on  such  language  like  sheeps’  clothing,  in their hearts they think with Arius, after the manner of the devil, who is the author of all heresies. For he too made use of the words of Scripture, but was put to silence by our Saviour. For if he had indeed meant them as he used them,  he  would  not  have  fallen  from  heaven;  but  now, having fallen, he acts evilness, in his mind.108</p>
<p>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLORILEGIUM’S STRUCTURE AND CONTENT</p>
<p>The  structure  of  florilegium,  as  is  evident  from  the  above presentation,  is  very  clear.  However,  one  must  make  some observations in this regard. First, taking into consideration what is mentioned in the introduction to the fifth chapter, namely the compiler’s  reference  to  what  he  has  mentioned  in  the  third chapter:  “as  was  clearly  seen  in  the  third  chapter  put  down above” (  ܬܝܐܝܠܓ ܐܕܗ ܇ܠܥܠ ܢܡ ܡܝܣܕ ܐܬܠܬܕ ܢܘܐܠܦܩܒܕ ܐܢܟܝܐ ܬܝܙ ̣ܚܬܐ),  it  becomes  evident  that  the  compiler  of  the florilegium is one person, and that the structure and division we</p>
<p>107  As  we  shall  see  below,  the  quoted  passage  derives  in  fact  from Athanasius of Alexandria’s Letter to the bishops and not as the text maintains from his First discourse against the Arians.</p>

Werke, Band I, Teil 1; Die dogmatischen Schriften, Lieferung 1: Epistula ad episcopos Aegypti et Libyae (Berlin-New York: De Gruyter, 1996), Sections 2.1–3.3.

<p>have  is  indeed  by  him.  Nevertheless, this  does  not mean  that errors or anomalies cannot be found in this structure. In fact, after  the  florilegium’s  title,  coloured  in  vermillion  in  both manuscripts, we have an introduction and then the quotations from John Philoponus’ Trinitarian works followed by those of the  Church  Fathers.  There  is  no  mention,  as  happens  in  the other chapters, of any subtitle to indicate the first chapter. This, indeed, caused G. Furlani to consider the whole introduction as a preamble to the first chapter.109 A. van Roey, on the contrary, separated the introduction into two parts, considering the first part  a  general  introduction  to  the  whole  florilegium  and  the second  an  introduction  to  the  first  chapter;  he  also  adds  the bracketed subtitle ‘Chapitre premier’ before this second part of the  introduction.110  Examination  of  the contents  of the  whole passage enabled me to agree with A. van Roey’s  conclusion. I have  therefore  indicated  the  first  part  of  the  passage  as  the florilegium’s  general  introduction  and  the  second  as  an introduction to the first chapter, and like van Roey, I have added the subtitle ‘Chapter one’.</p>
<p>Having  an  introduction  to  the  florilegium  one  might  also expect  a  conclusion.  In  fact,  the  passage  I  consider  to  be  the florilegium’s conclusion was also, to some extent, considered as such by G. Furlani, who translated it into Italian,111 as he did for all  the  chapter  introductions  and  for  the  passages  by  John Philoponus. A. van Roey, however, probably missed this passage and  his  analysis  makes  no  mention  of  it.112  Returning  to  the manuscripts we note that both consider this passage to derive from Severus of Antioch: a note in the margin of Ms C states ‘Of Severus’  (ܐܪܘܣܕ);113  while  Ms  E  has  ‘Of  Saint  Severus’  (  ̄ܕܩܕ</p>

<p>ܐܪܘܐܣ) in vermilion, without any information concerning the work from which this text was supposed to derive.114 However, on reading the contents of this passage, and considering that it was  impossible  to  identify  it  or  a  part  of  it  in the  writings  of Severus  of  Antioch  that  are  known  to  us,  it  is  clear  that  it contains  some  elements  that  cannot  have  been  written  by Severus,  including  the  reference  to  the  Tritheites  and  the mention of Theodosius of Alexandria as already deceased: No  one  should  believe [i.e.  Tritheites’s blasphemies],  because  in  the  Scripture[s]  those  who confess  substances,  natures,  gods  and  divinities concerning  the  Holy  and  consubstantial  Trinity  are anathematized,  although  they  say  [that]  these  [gods] are  consubstantial,  as  also  the  Holy  Theodosius refused, who [now] is among the saints.</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>We  know  in  fact  that  Theodosius  died  in  567,  thirty  years after the death of Severus of Antioch, so to consider this passage indeed  out  of  the  question. as  written  by  Severus Consequently, it is more than probable that the source of both manuscripts  had  wrongly  attributed  this  passage  to  Severus. Examination of its content leads, in fact, to conclude that it is, without  doubt,  the  conclusion  of  the  florilegium.  What confirms  this  hypothesis  is  the  way  the  compiler  ends  this passage,  giving  a  quotation  from  Athanasius  of  Alexandria’s Letter to the Bishops (wrongly considered by the compiler as the First discourse against the Arians)  as  support  for  his  position. The compiler, in fact, introduces Athanasius’ passage with the following way: “to prove, then, that this is so, we will mention, in order to conclude in a good way (ܢܢܝܡܠ ̇ܫܡ ܬܝܐܪܝܦܫ ܕܟ) ...”, which means that this whole passage is indeed to be considered the florilegium’s conclusion.</p>

<p>Bishara Ebeid</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>The aforementioned passage by Athanasius is not the only patristic quotation for which the compiler, or his source, gives wrong title of the work from which it derives. Quotation 18 of the third chapter is stated as deriving from Gregory of Nyssa’s Against Eunomius, instead of the same author’s Refutation of the Confession  of  Eunomius.  In  the  same  chapter,  quotation  23  is also wrongly attributed to Damasus of Rome’s Synodical letter to Paulinus,  Bishop  of  Thessaloniki,  whereas  it  actually  derives from Damasus’ Profession of Faith to Paulinus, known also as his Tomus; moreover, it is evident that the compiler, or his source, wrongly  considers  Paulinus  to  be  the  Bishop  of  Thessaloniki instead  of  Antioch.  Although  they  occur  frequently  in  the florilegia and in their sources, none of these errors were noted by G. Furlani115 or by A. van Roey.116 Neither did they note one another anomaly in the same chapter. The anomaly is found in quotations 12 to 17, which all derive from Gregory of Nyssa. The florilegium correctly attributes quotations 12 and 13 to Gregory of  Nyssa’s  On the Holy Trinity,  i.e.  his Letter to Eustathius,  and quotations 14 and 15 to Gregory’s On ‘Not three gods’, namely his Letter to Ablabius, but quotations 16 and 17, which derive from Gregory’s Letter to Eustathius, are ascribed to the same author’s Letter to Ablabius. This error was noted by neither G. Furlani117 nor A. van Roey whose analysis admits explicitly that he could not identify these quotations (16 and 17) in the Greek version of the Letter to Ablabius.118 Going back to the florilegium, one might maintain that the original order of the quotations was different, first those from the Letter to Eustathius, i.e.  quotations 12, 13, 16 and  17,  and  then  those  from  the  Letter  to  Ablabius,  namely quotations  14  and  15.  However,  taking  all  these  elements together and the fact that all these errors are found in the same</p>

<p>chapter  three,  one  might  hypothesize  that  the  source  of  the florilegium’s  compiler  had  already  made  these  errors  and imprecisions, which would mean that they were not made by the  compiler  himself.  In  my  opinion,  this  hypothesis  is  more plausible  than  asserting  that  the  copyist  of  the  archetype  of both  manuscripts  made  these  errors  and  created  such anomalies.</p>
<p>THE PROFILE OF THE COMPILER</p>
<p>David Taylor notes that this florilegium quotes seven passages from  the  first  Syriac  translation  of  Basil  of  Caesarea’s  On  the Holy Spirit;119 namely quotations 11-15 in the fourth chapter and quotations  17-18  in  the  fifth  chapter.  This  was  a  paraphrased translation,  where  the  translator  was  more  interested  in interpreting the Greek text than translating it.120 This element was  not  noted  by  A.  van  Roey  who  comments  that  he  could identify just a few phrases in the Greek text.121 David Taylor also noted  that  one  quotation  from  On  the  Holy  Spirit  in  this florilegium,  namely  quotation  5  in  the  first  chapter,  comes neither from the first nor the second Syriac translation of the work,122  which  means  that  the  compiler  used  more  than  one source for his florilegium.123 In fact, the compiler refers to Basil’s work  in  different  ways,  ‘Of  Saint  Basil  from  the  discourse  to Amphilochius’ ܐܫܝܕܩܕ ܣܘ ܝ ܟܠܝܦܡܐ)124 for  quotation 5 in the first chapter, and ‘Of Saint Basil  from  the  letter  to  Amphilochius  concerning  the  Holy</p>

<p>Moreover,  I  have  noticed that  quotations  19-20  in  the  fifth chapter,  which  derive  from  Basil  of  Caesarea’s  On  ‘Not  Three Gods’ are not faithful to the Greek text. Comparing them with a Syriac translation of this work – found in three manuscripts in the  British  Library,  namely  MS  BL  Add  17143,  ff.  46v-48v  (5th century);  BL  Add  14543,  ff.134r-140v  (6th  century),  and  BL  Add 14612, is  also  a paraphrased translation of Basil’s work – shows that they were based on a similar paraphrased translation and not necessarily the  version  testified  in  these  manuscripts.  The  point  is demonstrated  in  the  following  table,  where  I  present  Basil’s paraphrased translation according to MS BL Add 14543:127</p>

<p>On the one hand, we can say that the translation transmitted in our florilegium follows the paraphrased version but not to the letter; on the other, however, it is totally different from the one contained in MS BL Add 18813, ff. 82r-85v (7th century), BL Add 14618, ff. 32v-35r (7th/8th century) and Cambridge Add 3175, ff. 156v-159v  (10th/11th  century),  which  is  faithful  to  the  original Greek translation.131 This can also be confirmed from the titles given to Basil’s work in these versions. In fact, our florilegium calls it ‘Discourse on Faith and against those who falsify it saying three gods concerning the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit’ (  ܐܬܠܬܕ ܗܠ ܘܘܗ ܢܝ ̇ܫܥܕ ܢܝܠܗ ܠܒܩܘܠܘ ܇ܐܬܘܢܡܝܗ ܠܥ ܐܪܡܐܡ ܐܫܝܕܩ ܐܚܘܪܠܘ ܐܪܒܠܘ ܐܒܐܠ :ܪܡܐ ܢܝ ̈ܗܠܐ); MS BL Add 17143 and 14543 give the title as ‘Second discourse on Faith’ (  ܢܝܪܬܕ ܐܪܡܐܡ ܐܬܘܢܡܝܗ ܠܥܕ); MS BL 14612 as ‘Discourse on Faith’ (  ܐܪܡܐܡ ܐܬܘܢܡܝܗ ܠܥܕ); BL Add 18813 and 14618 as ‘Discourse on that it is not right to think three gods’ ( ܥ ܐܪܡܐܡ ܢܘܪܒܬܣܢ ܐܗܠ ̈ܐ), while in MS Cambridge Add 3175 it is entitled ‘Discourse  to  those  who  accuse  us  of  professing  three  gods’ ( ܢܝܪܡܐ ܐܗܠ ̈ܐ ܐܬܠܬܕ ܢܠ ܢܝܩܫ̇ܥܕ ܢܘܢ ̇ܗ ܬܘܠ ܐܪܡܐܡ).</p>

<p>A.  van  Roey  failed  to  take  account  of  this  element  in  his analysis of the florilegium, where he again simply indicates that he  could  not  find  an  exact  correspondence  in  the  Greek original.132  Consequently,  it  is  more  than  plausible  that  the</p>

<p>compiler was a Syriac-speaking Miaphysite. This is not the only factor that can support such a hypothesis. In fact, a considerable number  of  patristic  quotations  in  this  florilegium  are  also quoted in other texts written during the Tritheist controversy, namely (1) Theodosius of Alexandria’s On Trinity;133 (2) Various texts  published  by  G.  Furlani;134  (3)  Peter  of  Callinicum’s Trinitarian Corpus;135 (4) a Trinitarian florilegium based mainly on Peter of Callinicum’s Trinitarian Corpus.136</p>
<p>Theodosius  of  Alexandria’s  On  Trinity  was  originally composed in Greek but it exists in various Syriac translations of which the oldest, used for comparison in this study, is copied in MS  British  Library  Add.  14602,  which  dates,  according  to Wright,137  from  the  sixth  or  seventh  century.138  G.  Furlani demonstrated  that  the  texts  he  published  were  originally composed in Syriac;139 I have demonstrated that the Trinitarian florilegium  is  based  on  the  Syriac  version  of  Peter  of Callinicum’s  Trinitarian  Corpus140  on  which  L.  van  Rompay recently  expressed  his  doubts  as  to  whether  it  was  originally composed  in  Greek.  In  his  opinion,  it  is  more  plausible  that Peter wrote his work against Damian of Alexandria directly in</p>

<p>Syriac.141 In support of this position one might also add the fact that in Contra Damianum142 we find a quotation from a pseudo- Basil of Caesarea’s Against the Anomoeans (CPG 2988),143 a work that was originally composed in Syriac.144 In addition, and as we shall see below, it seems that Peter of Callinicum wrote his work against  the  Syrian  Miaphysite followers  of  Damian  of Alexandria and his Trinitarian doctrine.</p>

<p>Comparison of the texts, in fact, leads us to maintain that the compiler of the florilegium under examination, as well as the other sources, used existing Syriac translations either in integral or  in  fragmental  form. The  following  examples  should  clarify this  point,  starting  with  quotation  7  in  the  second  chapter, which derives from Severus of Antioch’s Letter to John and John the priests and abbots:</p>

<p>The  second  example  is  quotation  15  in  the  third  chapter, which  derives  from  Gregory  of  Nyssa’s  On  ‘Not  three  gods’,  to Ablabius, found similar in the Trinitarian florilegium based on Peter of Callinicum’s Trinitarian Corpus:</p>

<p>The  fact  that  this  quotation  was  not  identified  in  the incomplete version of Peter of Callinicum’s Trinitarian corpus known  to  us  today  suggests  that  both  florilegia  were  based either on the same source, which contains this fragment, or on the  same  integral  Syriac  translation  of  Gregory’s  Letter  to Ablabius.  The  next  example  offers  further  support  to  my hypothesis. Quotation 7 in the fifth chapter, which derives from Basil  of  Caesarea’s  Letter 38,  concerning the difference between substance  and hypostasis,  is  found  in  one  of  Furlani’s  texts  as well as in Peter of Callinicum’s Against Damian. The text in all these  sources  is  similar  to  that  of  an  integral  early  Syriac translation:</p>

<p>The last example is quotation 15 in the fifth chapter, which derives  from  Gregory  of  Nazianzus’  Oration  on  the  Lights  (Or. 39). This passage is quoted once in Theodosius of Alexandria’s On  Trinity,  three  times  in  Peter  of  Callinicum’s  Trinitarian Corpus, and twice in the Trinitarian florilegium:</p>

<p>All this clearly leads to the conclusion that the compiler of the anti-Tritheist florilegium was a Syrian Miaphysite who was directly  involved  in  the  Tritheistic  controversy  and  who  had access  to  various  patristic  texts,  mainly  those  which  already existed in an integral or partial Syriac translation, and that were in use among the different parties involved in the controversy.</p>

<p>WHERE AND WHEN THE FLORILEGIUM WAS COMPILED</p>
<p>One  another  extremely  important  detail,  noted  by  neither  A. van  Roey  nor  G,  Furlani,  remains  to  be  highlighted.  As  seen above, the compiler of our florilegium mentions Theodosius of Alexandria  as  already  dead  but  does  not  make  any  direct quotation from his On Trinity, even though he considers his own position to be in agreement with that of Theodosius, and that the  Tritheites  wrongly  consider  themselves  followers  of Theodosius.  The  texts  published  by  G.  Furlani  also  share  the same characteristics as our florilegium: they place Theodosius among  the  saints,  regard  his  doctrine  as  orthodox,  without making  any  quotation  from  it,  and  they  claim  that  the Tritheites, although they claim to follow Theodosius’ teaching, in truth they do not do so.163 On the contrary, the work of Peter of  Callinicum,  and  consequently  the  Trinitarian  florilegium based  on  it,  quotes  numerous  passages  from  Theodosius’  On Trinity.  These  various  factors  lead  me  to  maintain  that  our florilegium was composed in the same period and place as the texts published by G. Furlani. What strengthens this hypothesis is that both our florilegium and the texts published by G. Furlani are  silent  concerning  the  controversy  between  Damian  of Alexandria  and  Peter  of  Callinicum,  so  these  texts  must  date from before the controversy.</p>
<p>To  add  detail  to  this  hypothesis, another  element must  be taken into consideration: our florilegium quotes an extract from the letter sent by the ‘Orthodox [i.e. Miaphysite] bishops in the East  [i.e.  Mesopotamia]  to  the  Orthodox  [i.e.  Miaphysite] bishops  in  Constantinople’,  that  is,  quotation  22  in  the  fifth chapter.  In  both  manuscripts  this  extract  appears  to  be  a continuation  of  the  previous  passages  (quotation  21)  from</p>
<p>163 See, for example, Furlani, Sei scritti, 737–738, 759.</p>
<p>Bishara Ebeid</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Severus’ work Against the additions of Julian of Halicarnassus,164 an element that led G. Furlani to consider it as such.165 A. van Roey,  however,  noted  that  it  is  a  new  passage,  correctly understanding that it is related to Theodosius of Alexandria and identifying  the  direct  quotations  from  Theodosius’  On Trinity mentioned  in  it. What  he  did  not  notice,  however, is  that  the whole extract belongs to another text and is not by Theodosius himself.166</p>
<p>The aforementioned letter, from which this extract derives, was  composed  to  defend  the  writings  of  Theodosius  from misinterpretations by the Tritheites,167 a characteristic shared by our  ant-Tritheistic  florilegium,  and  the  aforementioned  texts published by G. Furlani. What distinguishes this letter is that it quotes  some  passages  from  Theodosius’  On  Trinity.  These passages differ, to some extent, from the Syriac translations of Theodosius’ work that are known to us. This is demonstrated in the  following  table,  which  compares  the  first  and  second quotations  from  Theodosius’  work  in  the  extract  of  our florilegium,  with translations  of three  different  Syriac Theodosius’ On Trinity:</p>
<p>Theodosius in the florilegium</p>
<p>The earliest known Syriac translation of Theodosius</p>
<p>The second earliest known Syriac translation of Theodosius</p>
<p>The third earliest known Syriac translation of Theodosius</p>
<p>164  In MS BL Add. 15432, this extract begins in folio 206r; while the folio where it is copied in MS BL Add. 15438, namely folio 144v, is damaged, even though it is clear that it was indeed considered a continuation of Severus’ quotation.</p>

<p>It is more than plausible that the letter was composed before the  first  Syriac  translation  of  Theodosius’  On  Trinity  was realised, and that its composers translated the relevant passages from  Theodosius  directly  from  Greek.  If  we  now  take  into consideration that the letter is copied in the same manuscript that contains the earliest Syriac translation of Theodosius’ On Trinity, I am led to conclude that both texts were produced by the same community. Consequently, our florilegium can also be dated to this same period, that is, before the first translation of Theodosius’  On Trinity  into  Syriac  was  made,  in  other  words, some time in the second half of the sixth century.174</p>
<p>Finally, for the place where our florilegium was composed, one might suggest that the compiler belonged to the Miaphysite community  of  Mesopotamia,  probably  in  Edessa.  To  explore this suggestion further, we need to take into consideration the</p>

<p>THE FLORILEGIUM AND DAMIAN OF ALEXANDRIA</p>
<p>Scholars today distinguish more than one phase in the Tritheist controversy;175  Theodosius  of  Alexandria’s  reaction  and  his composition  of  On  Trinity  belong  to  the  first  phase;  here  he disagreed  with  the  doctrine  of  the  first  Tritheites  but  did  not regard it as heresy. The position of Theodosius did not resolve the  problem  but  divided  Miaphysites  into  two  groups,  those who  agreed  with  him  and  those  who  disagreed.  It  is  worth noting that during the second phase, some Tritheites used the work of Theodosius as proof of the correctness of their doctrine. The above argumentation on the use of Theodosius  is indeed evidence supporting this element.</p>
<p>The aim of our florilegium, to return to our text, is explicit in its  title,  namely,  to  demonstrate  that  the  doctrine  of  John</p>

<p>Philoponus and his followers contradicts the Scriptures and the patristic  tradition.  We  are  informed  by  the  florilegium’s introduction and conclusion, moreover, that the compiler aims to  demonstrate  that  the  claim  of  his  adversaries,  i.e.  the Tritheites,  that  they  follow  Theodosius’  teaching,  is  merely verbal;  in truth their doctrine  is  in  contradiction with  that  of Theodosius.</p>
<p>According to the passages quoted from John Philoponus and his followers one can assert that their doctrine consists of the following  points:  (1)  since  the  hypostasis  is  an  individual concrete substance, and since Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three  hypostases,  they  are  consequently  three  concrete individual substances; (2) the general substance is an abstract reality, it has no real existence and exists only in the mind; (3) the unity in the Godhead is seen only in mental abstraction, i.e. at  the  level  of  the  general  substance;  (4)  the  three  divine hypostases (5) divinities; individual  substances consubstantiality  occurs  between belonging  to  the  same  general  substance;  (6)  each  concrete substance  differs  from  the  other  concrete  substances  of  the same general substance on account of its own characteristics, and therefore (7) each concrete substance, with its property, is considered a different species.176</p>

<p>To  confute  this  doctrine,  the  compiler,  through  the introductions he gives to the five chapters, affirms that (1) the divine  substance  is  one;  (2)  it  exists  really  and  not  in  mere thought; (3) it should be considered according to what Aristotle defines  as  substantia  prima;  (4)  it  is  subsistent,  that  is,  one concrete  and  single  substance;  (5)  it  is  neither  divisible  nor countable  in  the  three  hypostases;  (6)  consubstantiality indicates  hypostases  and  not  single  and  concrete  substances; and  (7)  substance  is  distinct  metaphysically  from  hypostases, which  are identified  with  persons  and  properties;  (8) consubstantiality  in  the  Godhead  indicates  the  unity  of  the hypostases,  that  is,  the  one  and  truly  existing  substance,  (9) which  is  one  and  the  same  in  the  three  hypostases,  and therefore  (10)  they  are  consubstantial.  However,  and  (11) although the hypostases are identified metaphysically with the properties, Sabellianism is rejected; thus, one might conclude that (12) persons-hypostases-properties are not understood as masks, but as substantial, i.e. not-abstract realities.</p>
<p>It is evident that the compiler’s metaphysical system is not the one established by the Cappadocians, which is based on the distinction  between  Aristotle’s  second  substance,  for  the common and shared, and the first substance, for the single and concrete realities, i.e. the hypostasis.177 It is clear, then, that even</p>

<p>if the compiler quotes the Cappadocians and other important Church  Fathers,  in  order  to  support  his  own  doctrine  as expressed  in  the  chapter  introductions  of  the  florilegium,  he differs  from  these  patristic  doctrines. Comparing  his  doctrine with that of Damian of Alexandria, one might maintain that the florilegium is to be regarded as the first steps of the Trinitarian teaching of a Miaphysite current with which Damian probably had  some  direct  or  indirect  relationships.  The  better  to understand this hypothesis, one must take into consideration the main metaphysical principles of Damian’s doctrine. These principles may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>(1)  There  is  a  clear  distinction  between  substance  and hypostasis;  (2)  substance  is  the  common  and  constituent element of being and (3) it exists concretely and not only in the mind; (4) hypostases are identified with the characteristic, also called hypostatic properties; as a consequence,  (5) there is no distinction  between  ‘name’  and  ‘things’;  (6)  hypostases  are distinct and incommunicable, but (7) each becomes substantial through  participation  in  the  substance,  i.e.  the  common  and constituent element of being, and  (8) it consequently gains a substantial  component;  therefore,  (9)  it  is  not  an  abstract reality.178</p>

<p>Comparing  the  doctrine  of  Damian  and  that  of  the florilegium, it is clear that the former is a development of the latter. Moreover, considering that we are sure that at least one of the quotations in the florilegium, namely quotation 9 in the third chapter, was used in one of Damian’s synodical letters,179 this  strengthens  the  hypothesis  concerning  the  relationship between  Damian  and  the  milieu  where  the  florilegium  was composed. As for Damian, we also know that he was a Syrian Miaphysite from the region of Edessa. In fact, his brother was the prefect of the city.180 Although he moved to Egypt at an early age, became a monk there, then a bishop and finally a patriarch, he  continued  to  have  contacts  with  the  Syriac  Miaphysite communities  in  his  native  area,181  and  therefore  it  is  very plausible that he belonged to, or at least had contacts with, the community  of  the  florilegium.  This  is  another  element  that supports what  I  have  maintained  above  concerning  the  place where the florilegium was composed.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Revisiting  the  anti-Tritheist  florilegium  in  MSS  BL  Add  14532 and 14538 and reading it in its doctrinal context has helped us, not just to date it and locate the place where it was composed, that is, during the second half of the sixth century among the Miaphysite community in Mesopotamia, probably in the region of Edessa, but also to add clarity to  the profile of the compiler</p>

<p>and his community: an anti-Tritheistic Syrian group claiming to be  followers  of  Theodosius  of  Alexandria,  who  regarded  the divine  substance  as  one  concrete  and  singular  substance,  i.e. according  to  what  Aristotle  defines  as  substantia  prima,  and considering  the  hypostases  as  properties  and  persons.  These details  shed  more  light  on  the  Tritheistic  controversy  among Syrian Miaphysites in its second phase, that is, after the death of  Theodosius  of  Alexandria  and  before  the  controversy between Peter of Callinicum and Damian of Alexandria.</p>
<p>In  fact, considering  that  the  texts  published  by  G. Furlani, which were probably composed in the same period and place as  our  florilegium,  do  not  share  the  doctrine  our  florilegium professes, but one that can be seen the first steps in the teaching developed by Peter of Callinicum, the adversary of Damian, one might  conclude  that  the  controversy  between  these  two Miaphysite  theologians,  which  caused  a  schism  between  the two  sees  of  the  Miaphysite  Church,  Alexandria  and  Antioch, started  as  two  different  Syriac  Miaphysite  reactions  against Tritheism, originating in Mesopotamia. Eventually the different approaches  became  two  different  currents,  so  some  modern scholars  are  not  totally  wrong  to  maintain  that  Peter  of Callinicum’s  Against  Damian  was  written  directly  in  Syriac, since,  in  my  opinion,  it  was  composed  to  oppose  the  Syriac- speaking Miaphysites, followers of Damian, that is, those of the milieu where our anti-Tritheistic florilegium was composed and transmitted. The fact, finally, that our florilegium is  contained in  two  manuscripts  that  also  copy  the Trinitarian  florilegium based on Peter of Callinicum’s Trinitarian doctrine182 reflects the coexistence  of  these  two reactions/currents against Tritheism among  Miaphysites,  which  started  before  the  controversy between Peter and Damian, and continued even after it ended</p>

<p>183 It can be maintained that these two approaches to Trinitarian doctrine continued  to  coexist  among  Miaphysites  for  centuries,  since  we  find  the west-Syrian Abū Rāʾiṭah al-Takrītī (d. 835) sharing the doctrine of Peter of Callinicum  (see  B.
