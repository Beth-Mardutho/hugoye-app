                              like to start with a crtitical observation made by Chip Coakley
                              that especially puzzled me; let me quote his remarks: "With
                              matters religious, ecclesiastical and missionary, Joseph is
                              less comfortable. The reader who is told that 'after the
                              Council of Ephesus, those who adhered to the teachings of
                              Nestorius organized their own church' which was subsequently
                              'forced to move in the direction of Mesopotamia and Persia' (p.
                              41, a statement admittedly at variance with most of the rest of
                              the chapter) will naturally be somewhat wary of the treatment
                              of ecclesiastical matters later on in the book."
                           </p>

                              citation above combines two of my sentences into one and omits

                              said--3rd paragraph of p.1 above--shows: 1 The church of Persia
                              is not mentioned at all; that is a subject yet to be discussed;

                              "They"--referring to "those who adhered to the teachings of
                              Nestorius" in Byzantine Edessa. In Coakley's restructuring of
                              my two sentences, where the name of Edessa is omitted, the
                              subject of "forced" is "church"-- which to Coakley, is "The

                              that after the christological controversies of the 5th
                              century--which I had just finished discussing--'Nestorianism'
                              continued to be preached and taught in the Roman empire.This
                              fact is well summed up by Arthur J. Maclean, of the Archbishop
                              of Canterbury's Assyrian Mission fame. Nestorianism, wrote
                              Maclean, "retained some footing in the Roman empire...", "for a
                              considerable time...", before it reached "the later Nestorians"
                              of Persia. (Maclean's article in <i>Encyclopedia of Religion

                              in my first two introductory chapters, Edessa was for long a
                              stronghold of Syriac learning and tradition in Byzantium,
                              highly regarded by the Aramaic-speaking eastern Christians.
                              Edessa was also a center of Greek learning, translated into
                              Syriac--"Greek learning in Syriac disguise," Han J.W.Drijvers
                              calls it. At the theological school of Edessa, Nestorian
                              doctrine was studied and developed, and so successfully, that
                              its leading opponents were eventually able to obtain from
                              emperor Zeno the closure of the school, in 489. It is pertinent
                              to note here that even after Zeno, during the reign of emperor
                              Anastasius, who succeeded Zeno, we still read of abused
                              "Nestorian clergy" in the very capital of the empire,
                              Constantinople. (J.B. Segal's <i>Edessa</i>, p.102.)

                              We know that Edessa grew into one of the leading religious

                              to Antioch, showed "a great variety of forms". (See R.

                              school of Nisibis which became the center from which Nestorian
                              teachings spread, leading to the establishment of "the later

                              ominous sign, that having banished the name 'Nestorian' from
                              the title, the author retains it elsewhere in the book, even in
                              the chapters covering the period after 1918 when it clearly
                              includes people other than members of the Church of the East.
                              For all that it may be a handy term, no theologically sensitive
                              writer could do this." Let me just say that as a member of the
                              Church who belongs to an earlier generation, when the name
                              Nestorian was still used--and as one who had a favorite uncle
                              named Nestorius--I did not feel the need to be either
                              diplomatically or theologically correct. If the term was
                              banished from the title of the revised edition, it was meant to
                              be changed only in the title, as explained in my prefatory
                              remarks, which Coakley well covers in his review.

                              missions (there are no tabulations of parishes, schools, books

                              review does Coakley say anything about the missions and
                              Islam--how Islam was viewed by the early missionaries; the role
                              that they hoped a "reformed Nestorian church" would play in the
                              conversion of Islam, seen on its deathbed; or on the reaction
                              of Muslims as they heard what they held holy being denigrated
                              by these Western clergy. Even when commenting on my concluding
                              chapter ('From Missions to Ecumenism'), where I survey Western
                              Christian Missions' admirable reassessment of their position
                              with regard to Islam--and other non-Christian faiths--Coakley
                              sees there only "a discussion of the exercise of 'rethinking
                              missions' ... and a section entitled 'The Roman Catholic Church
                              and Islam', neither of which", he writes, "is particularly
                              relevant to the Assyrians."

                              I will have a statement addressing that question, largely
                              citing passages from the book that seem to be overlooked.
                              Coakley, referring to page 69 of my text, writes, quoting a

                              'the political and cultural imperialism of the 'Christian

                              difficult time for their spiritual campaign. The Russo-Persian
                              conflict had already intensified Christian-Muslim animosities.
                              Gradually through the nineteenth century, these out-of-the-way
                              places, where the Nestorians had found refuge for the last five
                              centuries or more, were to become a hornets' nest, disturbed by
                              the political and cultural imperialism of the 'Christian'
                              powers."

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[12] The statement
                              above does not say that "these missions were the agents" of the
                              European powers; Coakley's clause actually distorts the meaning
                              and intent of the above passage.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[13] These
                              differences of opinion on the missions aside, let me express my
                              agreement with some of Chip Coakley's other critical
                              observations. He is right that I am not an ecclesiastical
                              historian, something that I have never claimed. On the history
                              of the early church, as I have noted before, I have depended
                              solely on reading scholarly secondary sources, some of them
                              written by a few readers of this newsletter. I have learned
                              much from the contributions of Chip Coakley himself; I dare say
                              that no one has found his details more fascinating than I have.
                              I agree with his comments on the absence of copy-editing; I
                              myself was shocked and irritated by the number of typographical
                              mistakes that mar many a page of the text. I take full
                              responsibility for whatever inadequacies there are; how I wish
                              I had paid a professional proof-reader to have a second look at
                              the typed manuscript. Finally, I want to thank Chip Coakley for
                              the gracious and favorable words that he has said about my book
                              as a whole. In my attempt to clarify my position--an unpleasant
                              task--I trust that I have not mis- interpreted him.
