                              mid-seventies have proven to be of such lasting significance
                              that there is reason, in a journal devoted to Syriac studies,

                              Professor P.A.H. de Boer (d. 1989) he wrote his dissertation,
                              <i>Inquiry into the Hebrew Text and the Ancient Versions of
                                 Zechariah IX-XIV</i> (no. 1), with which he earned his Ph.D. in
                              1949. Chapters are devoted to the Targum, the Peshitta, and the
                              Septuagint, while Syriac readings are used and referred to
                              throughout the dissertation. Moreover, several of the
                              additional theses, short statements that in the Dutch tradition
                              accompany the dissertation, deal with Syriac. Already during
                              his student years, therefore, Syriac must have been emerging as
                              an important focus of his scholarly interests. Jansma acquired
                              additional expertise in the Aramaic languages of Late Antiquity
                              including Syriac, Jewish Aramaic, and Samaritan Aramaic during
                              a period of study spent in Leeds and Oxford in 1949-50.

                              Leiden University appointed him full professor of “Hebrew
                              language and literature, Israelite Antiquities, and Aramaic”,
                              thus putting on his shoulder a heavy teaching load, which
                              seemed to leave only a little room for Syriac. For nearly a
                              quarter of a century Jansma’s teaching covered the whole field
                              that had been entrusted to him. Syllabi and student notes that
                              continued to circulate in Leiden even many years after his
                              retirement are a clear indication of the effect his teaching
                              had on students. He was a powerful teacher, who was always
                              extremely well prepared and who was able to capture the
                              attention and stimulate the imagination of students.

                              the late fifties the Peshitta project of the “International
                              Organization for the Study of the Old Testament” was set up in
                              Leiden, under the direction of Professor de Boer, Jansma took
                              upon himself the preparation of the edition of Genesis (which
                              appeared in 1977 – no. 6). There can be no doubt that he was
                              well-equipped to carry out this task, but he saw his work as
                              much more than that of a text-critic. As he wrote in his
                              dissertation “… text-critical work only goes part of the way.
                              It may find its completion by an exegetical study,” for
                              “judging and weighing is the work of exegesis.” (p. 59). This
                              must have been the background to his exploration, from the
                              mid-fifties on, of Syriac interpretations of Genesis. This
                              exploration led to a number of important publications that
                              arose out of Jansma’s reading of numerous published and
                              unpublished Syriac commentaries, treatises, and homilies.

                              <span class="tei-anchor" id="P5"></span>[5] In 1958,
                              Jansma published a paper of monograph length: “Investigations
                              into the Early Syrian Fathers on Genesis. An Approach to the
                              Exegesis of the Nestorian Church and to the Comparison of
                              Nestorian and Jewish Exegesis,” (no. 8). This is a remarkable
                              and still very useful survey of relevant Syriac texts, with
                              comments on the characteristics of each text, on its sources,
                              and on parallel passages drawn from Greek-Christian as well as
                              from Jewish writings. This study laid the groundwork for much
                              of the later scholarship in the field of East-Syriac biblical
                              interpretation. Along with the work of Professor Van den Eynde
                              in Louvain (d. 1991), who also in the fifties started his
                              exemplary edition and annotated translation of
                              Isho<sup>c</sup>dad of Merv’s Old Testament commentaries,
                              Jansma’s studies opened the field, identified the main texts,
                              and formulated interesting research questions. Subsequent
                              students and scholars owe a very great debt of gratitude to
                              these two scholars, Jansma and Van den Eynde. They worked on
                              the same texts, sometimes came to the same conclusions, and
                              admired each other’s work. They also had in common, however,
                              that they shunned public events and felt very uncomfortable
                              with personal attention – which helps explain why they never
                              met.

                              important publications that emerged from Jansma’s work in the
                              field of Syriac exegesis include his edition and study of
                              Syriac fragments from Theodore of Mopsuestia’s Commentary on
                              Genesis (no. 16), his study of interpretations of the Creation
                              and Paradise story in Jacob of Serug (no. 9) and Narsai (nos.
                              20, 23, 26, and 27), and his work on Ephrem’s Commentary on
                              Genesis (nos. 28, 33, 38). Text-criticism and the history of
                              interpretation are clearly interwoven in Jansma’s study of
                              specific Genesis readings in the Syro-Hexapla (no. 25),
                              Bardaisan (no. 24), Ephrem (no. 35), and Barhebraeus (no. 32).
                              His study of a number of anonymous homilies (in particular nos.
                              11 and 12) should be mentioned under this rubric as well.
                              Jansma’s critical notes on the published texts and translations
                              of Ephrem’s Commentaries on Genesis and Exodus (nos. 28, 31,
                              33, and 38) as well as on Narsai’s Homilies on Creation (no.
                              26) remain indispensable for those who study these texts
                              today.

                              addition to the biblical text and its interpretation, the
                              figure of Bardaisan and his legacy became an important theme in
                              Jansma’s work. What was initially intended as a review of
                              H.J.W. Drijvers’ monograph <i>Bardaisan of Edessa</i> (1966)
                              grew into a full monograph, which was published in Dutch in
                              1969: <i>Natuur, lot en vrijheid. Bardesanes, de filosoof der
                                 Arameeërs en zijn images</i> (no. 5). The most significant word
                              of the title is the last one, “images.” Jansma strongly argued
                              that the different sources providing information on Bardaisan
                              and his teaching cannot be brought together into one coherent
                              picture. We can hardly go beyond the different “images” which
                              each of the sources create and construct. Present-day students,
                              therefore, are like visitors in a gallery of paintings spanning
                              nearly 18 centuries of history. We see, one after the other,
                              portraits of Bardaisan, positive or negative, painted by such
                              skilled artists as his disciple Filippus, Sextus Julius
                              Africanus, Ephrem, … and in recent times, among others, by
                              Schaeder, Levi della Vida, and Drijvers. Jansma himself clearly
                              did not want to be one of these artists. With remarkable
                              sharpness he tried to read each of the ancient sources in its
                              own right, trying to understand what it was doing in its own
                              context, and painfully aware (and “filled with unspeakable
                              bitterness,” as the final sentence of the book has it) that the
                              real Bardaisan escapes from us, that we know neither his
                              writings nor his thoughts, and that we have not been able to
                              glimpse his face.

                              lightly footnoted. The reader is skillfully guided through the

                              monographs, published in 1959: <i>Oost-Westelijke
                                 verkenningen</i> (“East-West explorations” – no. 4). It is
                              built on a parallel reading of two travelogues: the Latin
                              report by William of Rubroeck of his journey to the Mongol
                              court in 1253-1255, and the Syriac narrative of Barsauma’s
                              travels to the Middle East and Europe at the end of the 13th
                              century. Closely following the texts and explaining them to his
                              readers in a lively fashion, Jansma delineates the ways in
                              which the Flemish monk saw Mongolia and the East-Syrian prelate
                              from the Beijing region saw Europe. The skills of the literary
                              critic and of the historian, which would become so prominent in
                              the Bardaisan book ten years later, are already to be found
                              here. At the same time, this book shows the versatility of the
                              author, who felt at home with any Syriac text between Bardaisan
                              and Barhebraeus.

                              1973, the Leiden chair of Hebrew and Aramaic was split up.
                              Jansma decided to leave the Hebrew part to a newly appointed
                              colleague, and to become the first incumbent of the new Aramaic
                              position himself. This could have been the beginning of a new
                              phase in his career, one entirely devoted to teaching and
                              research in the field of Aramaic and Syriac. Unfortunately,
                              soon thereafter his health no longer allowed him to continue
                              his work. He retired early, in his mid-fifties. Although he
                              recovered to some extent, he did not resume academic work and
                              chose not to participate in university life, in spite of his
                              close physical proximity to it. This was a source of great
                              sadness for his students and colleagues, who had to find
                              consolation in their memories and in Jansma’s written work. His
                              passing away now, more than thirty years later, at an advanced
                              age, accentuates the pain of his early departure and long
                              absence. However, in view of the rich diversity of his
                              scholarship and its remarkable depth, our feelings should in
                              the first place be ones of admiration and profound gratitude.
                              May he rest in peace!
