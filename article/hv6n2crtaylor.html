                              first Aram Society International Conference (on the Nabataeans)
                              was held as recently as 1989, but such has been the driving
                              energy and enthusiasm of the Society's founder, Shafiq
                              AbouZayd, that it has now hosted the twentieth in the series.
                              To mark this major milestone in the history of the society,
                              scholars came from around the world - South America, the Middle
                              East, the United States, and Europe - to present papers on the
                              appropriately celebratory theme of 'Alcohol'. As usual in Aram
                              conferences, papers by art historians and archaeologists were
                              mixed with those of specialists in literature, history, and
                              theology, and on this occasion the periods discussed ranged
                              across many millennia.

                              representation of alcoholic beverages and their consumption in
                              third millennium BCE Sumer and Akkad. Beer was consumed by all
                              classes of society, and the images of separate groups of both
                              men and women sitting sociably around large communal jars of
                              beer, sucking on huge straws, will not soon be forgotten by
                              those who saw them. (It may well start a whole new craze in
                              faculty parties!) Moving to the mid-second millennium, Natascha
                              Bagherpour Kashani reappraised the ancient Hittite 'cultic
                              vase' from Inandik. She convincingly argued that its cultic
                              function should be interpreted in the light of the images
                              painted upon it, which portray the brewing, conveying, and
                              consumption of beer in vessels similar in form to the vase, as
                              part of a religious ritual. The professionalism of the paper
                              was all the more outstanding given that the speaker is only
                              just completing her first degree. The third and final paper
                              concerned with beer was that of Max Nelson who, drawing upon
                              his forthcoming book on the subject, 'The Barbarian Beverage',
                              described its production in the Graeco-Roman world, including
                              northern Europe, and the attitudes towards it of contemporary
                              writers.

                              on to the second half of the first millennium, and moving from
                              beer to wine, Steven Derfler gave an illustrated account of the
                              excavation of wine presses at Tel Michal and the Sharon in
                              Israel, great centres of regional wine production over an
                              extraordinary period of time. The technology needed for wine
                              pressing was also explored by Amos Kloner who described the
                              structures and installations at Hulda, and some of the
                              corresponding data from Lebanon was presented by Moheb
                              Chanesaz.

                              papers explored the economic and social impact of the
                              production and trading of wine in different periods and
                              regions; Michael Decker's paper focussed on the wine trade of
                              Cilicia in Late Antiquity; Lukas Schachner investigated the
                              evidence for wine production in the early monasteries of Egypt
                              and the Levant; and Souad Slim took the conference forward to
                              eighteenth and nineteenth-century viticulture on <i>waqf</i>
                              land in Lebanon.

                              cluster of four papers related to wine and its use in the
                              Aramaic city states of Late Antiquity. Lucinda Dirven started
                              with images of banquet scenes from Hatra, and went on to argue
                              that many were associated with local veneration of the
                              ancestors which gave rise to an influential and widespread
                              funerary cult, as part of which memorial banquets were held on
                              key anniversaries not at the burial sites, as has previously
                              been argued, but in the city's numerous temples. She also
                              traced Heracles' supplanting of Nergal as god of the
                              underworld. Danila Piacentini examined comparable evidence for
                              the role of alcohol in the funeral ceremony and subsequent
                              anniversary commemorations at Palmyra. The final two papers in
                              this group neatly illustrated the difficulties involved in
                              interpreting archaeological evidence for ancient religious
                              practice and taboos. Joseph Patrich re-examined the evidence
                              for Nabataean veneration of Dionysus, who was identified with
                              the native Nabataean deity Dushara. Dushara is explicitly
                              stated in one inscription to forbid the consumption of wine,
                              and the absence of vine or grape motifs in the carved
                              decoration of the monuments in Petra is quite remarkable. The
                              obvious implication is that the Nabataean religion forbad the
                              drinking of wine, and that Dionysus was worshipped not in that
                              aspect associated with vegetation and wine, the aspect most
                              familiar to many of us, but in his role as god of death and the
                              afterlife. Zeyad al-Salameen, however, then presented an
                              account of excavations at a site (Beyda) a short distance away
                              from Petra where several contemporary wine presses had been
                              found in association with caves where wine might well have been
                              stored, and in one of which there was an inscription with an
                              imprecation addressed to Dushara. This strongly suggests that
                              Nabataeans were in fact both drinking and producing wine. How
                              are we to reconcile the two sets of evidence? Was the community
                              at Beyda prepared to overlook orthodox religious duty in favour
                              of economic gain? Or had Hellenism weakened this particular
                              demand of their religion? Or does some of the evidence need to
                              be re-examined or redated? Perhaps we shall learn the
                              resolution of this issue at a future Aram conference.

                              papers related to alcohol in Syriac sources. Shafiq AbouZayd
                              explored the evidence for the strict prohibition of the
                              drinking of alcohol in Syriac ascetic sources, and discussed
                              some of the possible explanations for its origins. Sebastian
                              Brock focussed on the spiritual theme of 'sober drunkenness'
                              which can be traced back to Philo and is also to be found in
                              the Macarian Homilies, and which frequently occurs in Syriac
                              writings in the form 'spiritual drunkenness'. This concept was
                              then followed with abundant examples as it evolved and
                              developed in Syriac spiritual and liturgical texts, and its
                              relationship to later Arabic Sufi texts was also suggested. An
                              example of Arabic literary influence upon Syriac, in the form
                              of the <i>khamriyyat</i> or wine songs of Khamis bar Qardahe
                              was discussed by David Taylor, who attempted to show how the
                              conventional motifs of the desire of the poet for the virgin
                              wine and the homoerotic longing for the cup-bearer were
                              redirected towards Christ, both wine and cup-bearer. It was
                              suggested that a probable context for these poems was the court
                              of the Mongol Il-Khanate at the end of the thirteenth
                              century.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[7] The
                              <i>khamriyya</i> genre in its Islamic context formed the
                              subject matter of Kathryn Kueny's paper, which focussed on a
                              poem of the early-thirteenth-century Cairene poet Umar ibn
                              al-Farid. This was a scintillating exploration of the literary
                              and religious tensions involved in a Muslim poet who has never
                              drunk wine, or who cannot admit to having done so, describing
                              the intoxication induced by the divine fragrance which brings
                              clarity of mind and an appreciation of what is real, a
                              drunkenness which restores the soul to the state of its
                              pre-existence. Another medieval Arabic text—an amusing
                              account of a man who falls unconscious through drink, is joined
                              by his friends who do likewise, and on his awaking he decides
                              to rejoin them, and so on, so that over several days of sharing
                              the same room they never actually meet each other
                              awake—was chosen by Bo Holmberg as the focus for a
                              fascinating examination of the longing for unconsciousness in
                              the light of modern psychological theory. The final paper on
                              alcohol in Arabic sources was Stephan Dähne's discussion
                              of an early-eighteenth-century Christian-Arabic sermon against
                              the sin of drunkenness produced by a European missionary in the
                              Lebanon. Amongst several memorable features was its claim that
                              humans began to drink wine after the flood because the water
                              had been contaminated by the corpses of those drowned!
