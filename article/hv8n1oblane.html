                              Theology. Encouraged by one of Britain’s leading Hebrew
                              scholars, Sir Godfrey Driver, he went on to read a second
                              undergraduate degree, Oriental Studies (Hebrew with Aramaic and
                              Syriac). He learned Syriac under L.H. Brockington, the reviser
                              of the much-used Robinson’s <i>Syriac Grammar</i>. Of
                              great value for his work in New Testament and Syriac was being
                              introduced to <i>Mishnah</i> and Jewish medieval commentaries
                              by Dr. David Patterson, later the founder and Director of
                              Oxford’s Centre for Hebrew Post-Biblical Studies.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[2] From
                              there he went as a student for priesthood to the College of the
                              Resurrection, Mirfield (just a few miles from his birthplace).
                              While there he won, by examination, the Oxford University
                              Hall-Houghton Syriac Prize. Instead of completing a second year
                              at Mirfield, he was asked by the Community of the Resurrection
                              to go to their seminary, Codrington College, Barbados, West
                              Indies. There he found himself teaching New Testament and
                              Greek, and later being Director of Studies. He was made a
                              deacon in Barbados, May 1962, and ordained priest in December
                              that year.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[3] In 1965
                              he returned to the UK, and for a year was assistant priest in a
                              parish in Oxford. Then he went to Pembroke College Oxford as
                              Associate Chaplain, and was awarded the Kennicott Hebrew
                              Fellowship. This enabled him to begin work on the Peshitta of
                              the Old Testament, again with encouragement of Sir Godfrey
                              Driver. It also began a very fruitful association with the
                              Peshitta Institute in Leiden, then directed by Professor P.A.H.
                              de Boer. Incidentally while at Pembroke he had the chance of
                              teaching Syriac to a slim young Indian, Deacon George, who
                              stayed with the Cowley Fathers. That Deacon George is now
                              Geevarghese Mar Ivanios. 1967 saw Lane as a tutor at St.
                              Stephen’s House, an Anglican seminary in Oxford, where he
                              continued University teaching in elementary Hebrew, tutored
                              theology students from many colleges, and continued work on
                              Peshitta <i>Qoheleth</i>. He retained a connection with
                              Pembroke College as its Lecturer in Theology.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[4] In 1971
                              Lane was invited to go as an Assistant Professor in Near
                              Eastern Studies in the University of Toronto. This began a
                              major period of Syriac activity: for the Leiden Peshitta
                              <i>Qoheleth</i> had been finished, and a revision of John
                              Emerton’s <i>Wisdom of Solomon</i> and <i>Song of
                                 Songs</i> followed, to be joined by work on
                              <i>Leviticus.</i> For two summers he was a Visiting Professor
                              at the Peshitta Institute, assisting with the edition of
                              Genesis and Exodus, and with <i>I and II Kings</i>. <i>The
                                 Leviticus</i> work produced the Leiden Peshitta edition of
                              that book, and a monograph which took Peshitta studies out of
                              simple text criticism of the Old Testament into the wider field
                              Syriac church history and liturgy, suggesting the theme of the
                              second Leiden Peshitta Symposium, ‘<i>The Peshitta as
                                 Translation</i>’. His published work to this point
                              enabled Oxford University to award him the degree of Bachelor
                              of Divinity: in Oxford this degree (based on publications) is
                              of a higher standard than, and senior to, a D.Phil. In 1976
                              came his first participation in the <i>Symposium
                                 Syriacum</i>at Chantilly, also Dr. Jacob 
                              Thekeparampil’s first, though it was at the 1980
                              Symposium at Goslar that they first properly met. At Goslar,
                              too, he was among the group of Syriac scholars whom the Indian
                              bishops approached with the idea of SEERI.

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[5] Although
                              a tenured Associate Professor, in 1983 Lane accepted an
                              invitation to join the staff of his old seminary, the College
                              of the Resurrection. There he became Director of Studies, then
                              Vice-Principal, and in 1990 Principal. He was also an Honorary
                              Lecturer in Old Testament at the University of Leeds. With the
                              encouragement of the Community of the Resurrection, of which he
                              is an Oblate member, he completed his work on the Peshitta, and
                              then began work on Syriac Fathers, especially
                              <i>Shubbalmaran</i>, 7<sup>th</sup> century metropolitan of
                              Kirkuk. Participation in the European <i>Symposia</i>
                              continued, and from 1990 participation in the SEERI
                              <i>Symposia</i> also. Articles and book reviews were asked
                              for and produced, but the most important Syriac activity was
                              his increasing involvement with SEERI when its Director invited
                              him to come as a guest Professor for the Syriac MA classes
                              recently begun at SEERI under the aegis of Mahatma Gandhi

                              <span class="tei-anchor"></span>[6] In fact,
                              since retirement from the College of the Resurrection in 1997
                              Lane’s whole time has been given to Syriac affairs, so
                              that this, his 70<sup>th</sup> year, sees the publication in
                              <i>Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO)</i> of
                              the two volumes (Syriac text and English version) of
                              Shubhalmaran’s <i>Book of Gifts</i>, a notable addition
                              to the range of Syriac ascetic writings currently available.
                              More recently there has been work on Jacob of Sarug’s
                              verse homilies. However, through the years there has been time
                              for priestly activity in the way of taking services and
                              preaching, and for associations with parishes in Toronto and
                              Cambridge. There has also been some little time for interests
                              in railways and gardening: his photographs of British steam
                              railways have appeared in journals and in books on railway
                              history; literary interests led him to be President of the Sir
                              Walter Scott Club of Toronto. He is currently on both the local
                              and national committees of the Scottish Rock Garden Club, with
                              a special interest in the alpine crevice plants known as
                              <i>auriculas</i> their leaves are like the little ears of
                              bears. They are small and beautiful in detail, and bred by
                              humans: appropriate for someone whose early interest was in
                              textual variants and the taxonomy of manuscripts.
