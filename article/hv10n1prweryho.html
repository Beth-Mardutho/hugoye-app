                              Christian visitors or immigrants in the West are often
                              surprised by the question “When did you convert to
                              Christianity?” Their indignant response is usually
                              “We have always been Christian!” Indeed,
                              Christianity had arrived in Iraq before it arrived in Britain
                              or anywhere in northern Europe. Today the number of Christians
                              in Iraq surpasses half a million (573,918 according to the 1997

                              author, Suha Rassam is a Catholic of the Chaldean rite, born in
                              Mosul. A medical doctor, she had been an Assistant Professor of
                              Medicine in the University of Baghdad. After coming to England
                              in 1990 she worked in London hospitals until her retirement
                              when she took an MA in Eastern Christianity at the school of
                              Oriental and African Studies in the University of London. In
                              this she is following in the footsteps of her distinguished
                              ancestors. During the heyday of medieaval Arab civilization
                              many famous Christian physicians had written works about
                              history and theology, or conversely, many theologians had
                              produced works about medicine. But, as far as I know, Rassam is
                              the first woman to combine the two disciplines.

                              presents a history of Christianity in Iraq from the very
                              beginnings until our own time. (The last date in the chronology
                              is 10 April 2005, recording the appointment of Mr.
                              Jaʿfari as Prime Minister). According to
                              tradition Christianity was first preached in Iraq by the
                              Apostle Thomas on his way to India and his fellow-Apostle, St.
                              Thaddeus. Or maybe even earlier? In his Prologue to the book
                              Monsignor Mikhael Al Jamil mentions the three Magi who had
                              visited the Infant Jesus in Bethlehem. Could they have been
                              Iraqis? The Magi were Zoroastrian priests, presumably ethnic
                              Persians, but Iraq was at that time part of the Iranian
                              (Parthian) Empire. Could they have brought back the news of the
                              Saviour, Saoshyant foretold by Zarathushtra?

                              Parthian Arsacid rulers of Iran and Iraq, nominal Zoroastrians
                              were quite tolerant of other religions. The situation changed
                              in 224 AD when they were overthrown by the Sassanids, ardent
                              Persian nationalists, determined to restore the ancient culture
                              of Iran without the foreign influences accumulated since the
                              conquest by Alexander 500 years before. Christianity, as a
                              foreign religion, was perceived as a threat, especially during
                              the constant wars between Zoroastrian Iran and Christian
                              Byzantium. The harshest and longest persecution in the history
                              of Iraqi/Iranian Christianity took place during the forty years
                              (339-379) reign of Shah Shapur II. The Chaldean church in
                              Montreal is dedicated to its numerous victims, <i>Les Saints
                                 Martyrs d’Orient</i>. The situation improved when the
                              Church of the East declared itself independent of Byzantium and
                              Rome (like in our times the Chinese Catholic Patriotic
                              Association in Communist China).

                              Christianity gradually divided itself into three mutually
                              hostile groups, accusing each other of heresy. Ostensibly the
                              conflict was over a formula expressing the human and divine
                              nature of Christ, but cultural differences played their part.
                              The so-called Melkites or “Royalists” (from Syriac
                              <i>malkâ</i>, Arabic <i>malik</i>,
                              “king”) accepted the doctrine promoted by the
                              Byzantine Emperor (and the Pope), as defined by the Council of
                              Chalcedon. The West Syrian or Syrian Orthodox Church (better
                              known as Jacobite after its famous preacher Jacob Baradeus) was
                              accused of denying Christ’s true humanity. Finally the
                              East Syrian Church or Church of the East, best known as
                              Nestorian for accepting the doctrine preached by Nestorius,
                              Patriarch of Constantinople, condemned by the Council of
                              Ephesus, refused to accept the term <i>Theotokos</i> (Mother
                              of God), insisting that Mary was the Mother of Jesus the Man
                              only.

                              of them were simply misunderstandings. The disputants had been
                              trying to apply Greek logic to issues which belonged to faith
                              more than to philosophy. Indeed, in 1994 the
                              “Nestorian” Church of the East and the Catholic
                              Church have issued a joint statement expressing their agreement
                              about the two natures and one Person of Christ. Better late

                              discernible signs as the liturgical language, Communion under

                              traditionally applied to the Church of the East and the Syrian
                              Orthodox Church by outsiders as incorrect and even offensive.
                              Nestorius was not even a member of the Church which goes by his
                              name! Likewise she proposes the term “Oriental Orthodox
                              Churches” for the so-called “Monophysite”
                              Churches (another incorrect term thrust upon them by their
                              opponents) which include the Syrian Orthodox Church and its
                              sister Churches in the Middle East to distinguish them from the
                              Chalcedonian “Eastern Orthodox Churches” of Eastern
                              Europe which follow the Byzantine tradition (p. 63). This may
                              work very well in English which provides us with the synonyms
                              “Eastern” and “Oriental”, but what
                              about other languages? In French we can say <i>Les Eglises
                                 Orthodoxes Orientales</i>, but what alternative do we

                              term “Nestorian”, while incorrect, does have an
                              illustrious history. Most of us have heard of the
                              “lost” Nestorian Christianities in the heart of
                              Asia. Persecuted or harassed in the Iranian Empire the Church
                              of the East had sent missionaries to India, to Central Asia and
                              China. Today some 20 million Christians in the Indian State of
                              Kerala use Syriac as their liturgical language. Nestorian
                              Christianity has disappeared from Central Asia and China by the
                              14<sup>th</sup> century, but some of its traces remain: The
                              Mongolian language is still written in a Syriac-derived script
                              in Inner (Chinese) Mongolia, as it was written in Outer
                              (independent) Mongolia until the introduction of Cyrillic in

                              Arab Muslim conquerors were welcomed by the Iraqi Christians as
                              liberators from the oppressive Iranian rule. Under

                              Sabi’ans, followers of monotheistic religions mentioned
                              in the Koran, were given certain rights as <i>dhimmis</i>
                              (“protected persons”). Under the ‘Abbasid
                              Caliphs, when Arab Islamic civilization had reached its apogee
                              Christians became particularly appreciated as translators of
                              Greek philosophy into Arabic and as physicians. Suha Rassam
                              quotes a story by Jâhiz about a medical doctor Asad bin
                              Jani who complains that he has no patients because he is a
                              Muslim, not a Christian (p. 83). Sounds eerily familiar: In
                              pre-War Poland Jewish doctors were perceived as more competent
                              than their Polish Catholic colleagues. The joke went that every
                              anti-Semite made an exception for his doctor. Understandably
                              Christian success had created resentment. Even such leading
                              intellectuals like Jâhiz and Tabari found it necessary to
                              write anti-Christian polemics.

                              Iraqi Christians spoke Syriac. Gradually they began to change
                              their language from Syriac to Arabic although they continued to
                              attend Syriac churches. Today Syriac-speakers are a minority,
                              even among the Christians of Iraq. Rassam’s Mosul family
                              had always been Arabic-speaking, at least as far as her
                              great-grandmother could remember. Our author speculates that
                              she may be descended not from Chaldeans who had lost their
                              language, but from Arabs who had converted to Christianity
                              before Islam (p. 128, n. 6). She does not mention any

                              Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258 was of course a catastrophe
                              for the Arabs, but, paradoxically enough it put Christians in a
                              position of advantage compared to the preceding period. For all
                              their barbarity the Mongol rulers had one great virtue:
                              complete religious tolerance. Indeed many of them were members
                              of the Church of the East. <i>Jizyah</i>, the special tax
                              which the <i>dhimmis</i> had to pay in lieu of military

                              were abolished. The year 1287 saw the first attempt at
                              reconciliation between the Church of the East and the Catholic
                              Church. The Patriarch Yahballaha III sent his Bishop, Bar Sauma
                              to Rome with letters from the pro-Christian <i>ilkhan</i> of

                              fortunately no military alliance materialized, but Bar Sauma
                              was warmly received by the Pope and allowed to participate in
                              all church ceremonies like a Catholic Bishop in good standing.
                              The Christian-Mongol “honeymoon” ended in 1295 when
                              Argun’s son and successor, Ghazan converted to Islam. The

                              was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1534. The Ottomans
                              governed their recognised non-Muslim minorities through the
                              <i>millet</i> system. <i>Millet</i>, derived from Arabic
                              <i>milla</i> (“sect”) means “nation”
                              in Turkish. Each “nation” was given a large measure
                              of inner self-government with the Patriarch or leader holding
                              civil as well as ecclesiastical authority with the
                              responsibility of collecting taxes for the Ottoman
                              Government.

                              origins of the Chaldean “Uniate” Catholic Church
                              can be traced to 1552 when a rival Patriarch of the Church of
                              the East, John Sulaqa asked for and was granted recognition by
                              the Pope. The Patriarch Shimʿon VIII
                              Dinkha, recognised as head of his <i>millet</i> had him
                              thrown in prison by the Ottoman authorities. The union lasted
                              on and off with the two lines of Patriarchs exchanging their
                              positions until it became permanent in 1830 when John VIII
                              Hormiz was given by the Pope the title “Patriarch of
                              Babylon over the Chaldeans”. The Chaldean Catholic
                              <i>Millet</i> was recognised by the Ottoman authorities in
                              1844. Today the Chaldean Catholic Church forms the largest
                              Christian community in Iraq. The Iraqi Christians are perfectly
                              justified in their proud boast “We have always been
                              Christian”, but they stand on less firm ground when they
                              claim “We have always been Catholic”.

                              Meanwhile the Church of the East, much reduced in numbers found
                              refuge in the almost inaccessible Hakkâri Mountains in
                              southeast Turkey. Its faithful, claiming descent from the
                              ancient Assyrians displayed the war-like qualities of their
                              ancestors. No Ottoman military or tax collector dared enter
                              their territory. The chiefs of their seven tribes bore the
                              grandiose title <i>Malik</i> (“King” in Arabic).
                              Over the seven Kings stood the Patriarch of the East whose
                              office had become hereditary from uncle to nephew in the Mar
                              Shimʿun family. Their virtually independent
                              state bore a remarkable resemblance to Montenegro, unconquered
                              by the Turks and likewise ruled by hereditary (uncle to nephew)
                              Orthodox Bishops.

                              During the First World War, the Assyrians, encouraged by
                              Russian and British agents, openly rebelled against their
                              nominal Turkish overlords. Driven out of Turkey into Iran whose
                              declared neutrality was respected by neither party they
                              captured the largely Assyrian city of Urmiyé. They held
                              their own against Turkish, Iranian and Kurdish attacks until
                              August 1918 when they decided to trek south to British-occupied
                              Hamadan. Some fifteen out of sixty thousand perished on the
                              way. The British, who had by that time occupied most of Iraq,
                              removed them to Baʿqubah where they trained
                              the wild mountain guerrillas into a modern army. The so-called
                              Assyrian Levies ranked among the toughest soldiers in the
                              British Empire, equal to Sikhs and Gurkhas. Their loyalty to
                              their British allies would cost them dearly.

                              1920 the British liberators of Iraq had outstayed their welcome
                              and an uprising broke out in the South. It was put down,
                              largely with Assyrian help, but the British were forced to
                              grant self-government to Iraq with Faysal I as King. Formal
                              independence followed in 1932. Rassam greatly admires King
                              Faysal for his lack of prejudice against religious minorities.
                              She quotes him with approval (p. 134): “I do not want to
                              hear that this country contains Christians, Jews or Muslims
                              because <i>we are all Semites</i> [emphasis added by the
                              reviewer] forming one nation called Iraq...” True, the
                              Chaldeans, the Assyrians, the Jews and the Arabs are Semites,
                              but the Kurds are not. Rassam does not comment.

                              Iraqi independence the British disbanded the Assyrian Levies,
                              hated by the Arab Muslim population. Fearing the worst, the
                              Assyrians refused to surrender their arms. A clash with the
                              Iraqi Army became inevitable. King Faysal, very ill, tried to
                              avert the tragedy, but was ignored by his Prime Minister,
                              Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, a Fascist who would stage a pro-German
                              coup d’état during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War.
                              Meanwhile his government created a general panic by
                              exaggerating reports about the strength of the Assyrian rebel
                              forces and the danger they represented. Unable to hold their
                              own against the Iraqi Army the Assyrians were massacred in the
                              summer of 1933. King Faysal died soon afterwards. The Patriarch
                              of the East, Mar Eshai Shimʿun was expelled
                              from the country and not allowed back until 1970. Needless to
                              say, the Assyrian problem did not make life easier for the
                              other Christian communities in Iraq.

                              proclaimed. In 1968 power was seized by the
                              Baʿath (“Renaissance”) Party,
                              an Arab nationalist party founded by a Christian Arab political
                              philosopher, Michel Aflaq. Its secular nationalism appealed to
                              many young Christian Arab intellectuals. “A sense of
                              belonging to the country as an Arab, an Iraqi and a Christian
                              was encouraged but only through being a
                              Baʿathist” (p. 149). Saddam Hussein
                              succeeded Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr as President in 1979. Whatever
                              his misdeeds as a ruthless dictator he never perpetrated nor
                              permitted any iniquity against the Christians. He appointed

                              Minister, Tariq Aziz. If Christians suffered under his regime,

                              time, Rassam is forced to make a comment about the current
                              situation. She has little sympathy for the American-led
                              invasion, as is shown by her use of the term
                              “occupation”, a term the self-proclaimed
                              “liberators” of Iraq would protest against. She
                              quotes with approval the joint statement of the Bishops of
                              Mosul of all denominations (p. 190): “...We ask the
                              occupying forces and all foreign armed people to leave the
                              country.” The “foreign armed people” are
                              Muslim volunteers come to Iraq to fight the Americans. They
                              have carried out indiscriminate killings, not only of Americans
                              and the new Iraqi Army and Police, but of ordinary Iraqis,
                              Christians and Muslims. They have carried out bomb attacks
                              against Christian churches which have been condemned by all
                              Iraqi Muslim religious leaders, Sunni and
                              Shiʿa. Since the book was published
                              Shiʿa and Sunni mosques have also been
                              destroyed by bombs, so that now all Iraqis, Christians and
                              Muslims are in the same desperate situation. The last chapter
                              “Iraq under occupation and transitional rule” does
                              not make happy reading, but the overall message of the book
                              need not be pessimistic. Iraqi Christians (and all Iraqis) had
                              survived persecution, foreign invasion, civil war in the past
                              and this could be the ultimate lesson from history.

                              in Baghdad directed by French nuns and indeed she mentions Fiey
                              in note 32 on p. 75 without giving the title of his book. The
                              Arabic titles are given in English translation only, without

                              unfortunate slip of the pen occurs on p. 173: In enumerating
                              the Chaldean churches outside Iraq the author counts “two
                              in Iran”. Maybe she means the two Archdioceses, Tehran
                              and Urmiyé. As to parish churches, there are in Sanandaj
                              (the former See of the Archbishop of Tehran), in Salmas, in
                              Kermanshah, in Hamadan, and in Ahvaz.

                              book fills a much needed lacuna. Most educated Westerners have
                              heard of the Copts in Egypt, the Maronites in Lebanon, but the
                              presence of the Chaldeans and other Christian groups in Iraq is
                              largely unknown. Although the book is written with the general
                              reader in mind, the Orientalist scholar will find much useful
                              information in it. Its scope extends beyond its stated subject
                              matter. Iraq is not an island, geographically or figuratively
                              speaking, and Iraqi Christianity is placed within a wider
                              context. We learn about the history of the Christian Church and
                              its Christological controversies of interest to theologians,
                              about the history of the Middle East, and of the neighbouring
                              countries, Iran, Syria and Turkey. I believe that the history
                              of a religious or ethnic minority throws a new perspective on
                              our view of the society in general. (“Black
                              Studies” teach us something not only about the history of
                              Black people in North America, but also about American and
                              Canadian history as such). The author’s references to her
                              personal experience as an Iraqi Christian add a lot to the
                              charm of the book. There are those who believe that a scholarly
                              work has to be dry and impersonal, excluding any
                              “anecdotal” material to be truly
                              “academic”. This reviewer does not share that view
                              and would recommend the book to all readers interested in Iraq
                              and the Middle East.
