  { "fullText" : "[1] �Fire from Heaven� is the fourth volume of Sebastian Brock�s collected articles in the Variorum Collected Studies Series The previous volumes were: Syriac Perspectives on Late Antiquity (VCSS 199, 1984); Studies in Syriac Christianity (VCSS 357, 1992); From Ephrem to Romanos: Interactions between Syriac and Greek in Late Antiquity (VCSS 664, 1999). (the titles of all the papers are listed in full at the end of this review), and as the title of the volume suggests, a majority of the papers (10 out of 17) are related to the invocation and descent of the Holy Spirit in Syriac sources. Four of these (X-XIII) explore the history and development of the technical vocabulary used in Syriac to describe this descent (primarily aggen , but also shrā , n h et , ra hh ep ) in biblical, liturgical, and homiletic texts. Other papers (V-VI) address the visualisation of this descent in the form of fire, and the Syriac development of the concept that the Holy Spirit is essentially female, leading certain writers and texts to describe her as �Mother�. Three papers (VII-IX) focus on the eucharistic anaphoras and epicleses, and it is worth noting that VIII includes a very useful table listing all 71 of the known West Syrian anaphoras, together with references to available editions or, if unpublished, inclusion in key manuscripts. A final paper (XIV) in this section examines the debate among Syriac writers about how best to translate rua h elohim in Genesis 1.2. [2] The volume begins with three important articles on the christology of the Church of the East which will be of great assistance to anyone who has to grapple with the theological complexities involved. All three include variant versions of a table which graphically demonstrates the extraordinary range of christological opinions that were being expounded in the fifth to seventh centuries, and seeks to undermine the arguments of reductionists who wish to focus on just two or three rival schools of thought. This table will be well-known to Sebastian�s colleagues and former students, nearly all of whom have copied it and made use of it shamelessly in their own teaching! (The version of the table in paper II is the most complete, but cross-reference to the others will add clarification.) The fourth paper is a stimulating discussion of the theme of Christ as hostage, hmayrā , in East Syriac thought. [3] The volume ends with three articles on early Syriac liturgical commentaries. Papers XV and XVI provide an edition, translation, and analysis of a single short, but highly influential, commentary on the baptismal and eucharistic liturgies which predates the fifth-century church divisions and is preserved in Syriac in Melkite and Syrian Orthodox manuscripts, as well as in a fragmentary Soghdian translation produced by the Church of the East. Article XVII is a translation and study of the early seventh-century commentary on the liturgy by Gabriel of Qatar. (Unfortunately the lengthy Syriac edition of the text, included in the original article, is not reprinted here, but can be consulted online in Hugoye Vol. 6.2 [July 2003]). [4] Sebastian Brock�s scholarship is, as always, ground-breaking and of outstanding quality, and given that his work is frequently published in a diverse range of journals and Festschriften, some more easily found in libraries than others, the convenience of having these articles collected together in a single volume will clearly recommend it to Syriac scholars and to libraries with an interest in Syriac Christianity, Patristic theology, or liturgical studies.
